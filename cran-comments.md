## Reverse dependencies

I ran revdep checks on the 272 reverse dependencies (complete results at
https://github.com/hadley/scales/blob/master/revdep). There were issues with
three packages; one of these issues appears unrelated to `scales`. The package
maintainers were notified of the issues that are related to `scales` changes on
10 August 2017.
